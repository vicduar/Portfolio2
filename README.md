#Unit 2 Challenge

##Description

Work on this project was implemented at the request of the client, whose user story stated the following: "I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position."

The specific topic is creating a portfolio to be used as a submisssion to potential employers in order to showcase my qualifications for an open position.

The project solves the problem of not having a portfolio available to submit to potential employers.

A great deal of knowledge was obtained through the design and completion of this project, from fortifying knowledge of HTML and CSS, research of questions using the internet, the process of using Git and Github, and learning how to debug broken code.

The steps required to start the development environment running include: opening VS Code, Github, Git (and Terminal). Once the project was created on my local repo then it was linked to Github, to save changes as updates are made. In Github, a remote repo is created and linked via Git. Once this link was made using several Git terminal commands, the project was “off and running.” The project was created using VS Code. It is here that the bulk of time spent designing was spent. Following these steps, the project and changes were uploaded to Github. The final project was then deployed to the web.
